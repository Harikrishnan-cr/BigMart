  "Our core mission is to provide chemical-free, unadulterated food to consumers. We take great pains to ensure that we go directly to the fishermen or farmers without any middlemen in between and buy the freshest of fresh food straight from the source. Further, we follow the most modern & scientific transportation and packaging processes from source till your door steps. This ensures that the required temperature and other conditions for healthy preservation of meats is met using nothing but natural ice as the preservative.",
  "How we wish that were true! We have observed that a large percentage of the fish available in the local market has Ammonia in them. A smaller percentage has Formalin.",
  'We take great care to ensure there are no growth promoters such as hormones, antibiotics and other bad stuff in the poultry that you buy from us. The growth promoter bit is easy – if you are ready to take a hit on the profit margin and are ok with poultry such as chicken not growing to the largest size before slaughter, then you don’t need to add any growth promoters. In fact most vendors in the market today do not add hormones in chicken and is a common myth. Now we take the concept to the extreme for health reasons and take a hit on the profitability in return for a smaller bird - that is why you see that our whole chicken is only between 1-1.3 kg after cleaning, generally the chicken available in the market would be much bigger. The good news though is smaller chicken is more tender and much more tastier.',
  "The antibiotics part in Chicken is a more complicated story. We ensure that we take the broiler chicken from institutional farmers who are FSSAI/HACCP certified and also conduct lab test on each batch of chicken for the presence of antibiotics or other growth promoters. We also closely keep tab on the product to ensure that the final meat is free of antibiotics before it reaches your doorsteps. The devil is in the details, so allow us to explain - Broiler Chicken is not practical to be farmed commercially without any antibiotic use in the early stage of its life cycle.You could actually cause more harm than good by not giving the appropriate medicines/vaccines in the early stage of growth. However in the interest of maximising profits, some of the market vendors over use antibiotics (and also other growth promoters) all the way till the bird is slaughtered. The main way in which this is done is by mixing the antibiotics in the feed and water. What we do differently is to ensure that our farmers follow the withdrawal method - each antibiotic has a well defined half life period, which is the time it gets dissipated from the birds blood stream and body, similar to what happens to human beings when you are sick - the antibiotics from the medicines are in your blood only for a small period of time. Our farmers ensure that no antibiotic are used for a large period of time prior to the slaughter – hence there is no possibility of it coming in to the food you eat. We also ensure that there is natural minerals added in the feed making the chicken more healthier. Additionally our broiler chicken are all reared at the same age to avoid infections which is not the case with the chicken you get from the market. Also our rearing is done in large areas where the cross breed infection possibility is rare.",
  "In the case of larger birds like duck or country chicken, antibiotics are not needed at any stage as they are more sturdier birds and they are reared in a free range fashion.0",
  "No, only the Country Chicken varieties are Free Range birds. The others are reared naturally but not in the open farms which qualify for Free Range rearing.",
  "Simple - we procure the day's catch from fisherman hours after they actually fish and come to the shore. Our well oil-ed processing center ensures that the fresh catch reaches our plants within no time of the catch landing on the shore. At our delivery end, we have a network of vehicles that pick up the product from the airport/train stations and deliver to your doorsteps. We do not depend on any courier companies and have sourcing and delivery fully under our control - while this is expensive, it allows us to give you the worlds best fish in the fastest time possible from source to destination.",
  "The fish reaches your home within a few hours of catch landing from the sea- our estimate is that it is in your kitchen within 20 to 35 hours of catch landing at the harbor. The catch is not treated with chemicals such as Formalin, Chlorine or Ammonia, which means what we supply, is the safest and healthiest seafood you can buy. Almost all seafood you find in your local market is invariably treated with one or other chemicals to preserve it. These chemicals are harmful to human beings and actually deprive the seafood of its freshness and natural taste.",
  "We have our own logistics and delivery work force, so we have a fair amount of control on our schedules. The two factors that are not in our control are train and airline schedules - our two primary means of supply in to the Cities. However these are extra ordinary situations and barring acts of God, we deliver on time 99.99% of the time.",
  "Yes, there is a big difference in taste of the same fish caught in one ecosystem versus the other. For example - it is very well known that the best tasting Hilsa actually comes from the fresh waters in Bangladesh. Similarly for Marine fish, some of the best tasting fish comes from the southern coasts of India, especially the Kerala belt where there are a lot of lagoons. The waters there are comparatively pollution free and this enhances the taste. The fish caught from polluted waters will generally have pollutant/toxin accumulation in the tissue leading to bad taste and unsavoury odour. The southern seas in general are well protected from factory effluents and sewage. It is also scientifically proven that the taste of the fish is directly linked to the fatty acid and amino acid profiles of the organisms on which they feed on! If the prey has a better nutritional profile, it will contribute to the profile of the predator. For example, Kerala waters are almost free from toxic dinoflagellates and other phytoplankton blooms which make the fish safe and tasty for consumption.",
  "Yes all meats are 100% halal cut.",
  "We provide fish that is a week to 6 months fresher than the fish that you currently get from the market and deliver that at potentially much lower prices than the local market. What this means is that we operate with razor thin margins and for us to break even we need to add a delivery charge based on the location. As our volumes increase, we are hoping we can lower this cost.",
